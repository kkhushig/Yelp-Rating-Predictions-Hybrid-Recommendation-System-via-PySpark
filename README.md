# Yelp-Rating-Predictions-Hybrid-Recommendation-System-via-PySpark
This project implements a hybrid recommendation system utilizing a combination of user and business metadata from Yelp datasets. By switching from XGBoost to CatBoost, I improved the model's RMSE from 0.9824 to 0.9791. The system employs collaborative filtering and regression techniques to enhance prediction accuracy efficiently.
